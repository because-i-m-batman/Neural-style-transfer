# Neural-style-transfer
Using tensorflow Image Stylization model.
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

# How to run
Provide content image and style image path inside the neural_style_transfer.py file

# Output
out.jpg file will be created
